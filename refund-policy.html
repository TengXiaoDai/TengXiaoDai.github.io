            <p>
                Our General Refund Policy is:<br>
                Before making a payment, you "the customer" are informed that by making a payment you agree to our "Refund Policy". This statement is available in all confirmation e-mails and site-wide in the footer/bottom section of our website. We make no exceptions regarding this policy.<br>
                - We won't under any circumstance issue a refund on the basis of "changing your mind". This also applies to submitting a payment and then trying to reverse it for any reason(s), including no reason provided.
            </p>

            <p><strong>General cases where refunds can be issued: </strong></p>

            <p>
                - If you do not receive your purchased service within a maximum of 24 hours upon receiving a cleared payment, you are entitled to a full refund. This policy does not apply to "Pre-Order" type of services
            </p>

            <h3>2.0 Game Currency "game items" Terms of Service & Refund Policy</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>2.0.1 Terms of Service for Game Currency "game items" purchases</strong><br>
                It is solely your "The Customer" responsibility to double check all the details before submitting a payment. Usually, these details are: Game, Game Server / Realm name, amount of game currency "game items", faction (where applicable) and the name of your in-game character which serves as "virtual game delivery address". <br>
                1) By submitting a payment, you understand that different game servers usually have different pricing of our services associated with each game server / realm. <br>
                2) By submitting a payment, you understand and accept the risk of not having the service correctly provided to you as a result of incorrect details provided by you when submitting the payment. While we will do our best to try to resolve the issue, not all issues are resolvable, especially if the service is already provided (game currency is delivered in-game using the details provided by you in the payment invoice) by our network partners and team members.<br>
                3) You agree that Wow TBC Gold is not responsible for covering financial loss & costs caused by input of wrong details / credentials by you "the customer". Our system automatically arranges which team member or network partner will fullfil the order. To prevent abuse of our services, no refunds are to be issued for wrong details (including but not limited to Game server name, In-game faction, or in-game character name).<br>
                4) We are recording each game currency "game items" delivery process by utilizing applicable software and methods. We use these files as evidence for fraudulent non-delivery disputes and claims to prevent abuse of our services. You agree that you accept these kind of files as a service delivery proof. For preview, screenshots may be hosted/uploaded on our website (Wow TBC Gold) or elsewhere, videos may be hosted/uploaded as unlisted videos on Youtube or our website (Wow TBC Gold) or elsewhere.
            </p>

Please double check your information before making a payment. In case you have inserted incorrect credentials, please try to resolve the issue as soon as possible by contacting us on one of our e-mail addresses: orders@Wow TBC Gold.gold. We can not guarantee that we can resolve any issue due to wrongly inserted "virtual game delivery address" especially if the game currency "game items" is already delivered. We will not accept any game currency "game items" refund requests within 24 hours of purchase due to the way purchases are distributed and assigned throughout our gaming network. If you can not wait, make sure that we can deliver right away or faster by contacting us on our e-mail addresses or through the website chat.

            <p>

Cancellations and full refunds are not allowed nor issued for any reason.
